Let's check out and run some useful commands via the CrowdSec CLI `cscli`.

To get an overview of all options, just run the command: `sudo cscli -h`{{execute}}

If you want to access all options easier and faster, just install the bash completion:
`cscli completion bash | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/cscli`{{execute}}
`source ~/.bashrc`{{execute}}

Test it out by typing: 
`sudo cscli <TAB x 2>`
