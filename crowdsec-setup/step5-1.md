CrowdSec offers also the cloud service [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net).
This service allows you to analyze multiple instances in one central web dashboard.

To use this service, just sign up at [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net).

When logging in for the first time you will be presented with your enrollment key. If you cannot find this, head into the `instances`{{}} tab and find `add instance`{{}}. Clicking on this will show you your enrollment key.

>It is important you keep this safe as the enrollment key is unique to your account and should not be shared.
