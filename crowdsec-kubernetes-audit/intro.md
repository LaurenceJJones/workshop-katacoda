In this workshop, we will see how to configure crowdsec to analyse a kubernetes cluster audit logs to warn you about potential dangerous actions happening in the cluster.

During this course, you will:
 - Make sure the cluster is up and running
 - Inspect the crowdsec configuration
 - Inspect the cluster audit configuration
 - Create a privileged pod to generate an alert
