Let's test our trigger bucket!

We can send an empty POST request to the homepage. This should never happen in the application, since the form uses required attributes.

```
curl -X POST --data "username=&password=" http://127.0.0.1:3000/ > /dev/null 2>&1
```{{exec}}

We can verify this scenario works by running:
```
cscli decisions list
```{{exec}}

If you see a decision for `10.10.10.10`{{}} then the detection is working correctly!
