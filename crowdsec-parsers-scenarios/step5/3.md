Lets test our trigger bucket!

Simply we can send an empty POST request to the homepage, this should never be the case within the application since we have the required attribute on the form.

```
curl -X POST --data "username=&password=" http://127.0.0.1:3000/ > /dev/null 2>&1
```{{exec}}

We can make sure this scenario works by running
```
cscli decisions list
```{{exec}}

If you see a decision for `10.10.10.10`{{}} then the detection is working correctly!
