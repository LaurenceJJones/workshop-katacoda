Let's test our bruteforce detection scenario

Simply we can roll our own bruteforce using curl

```
for i in {1..20}; do curl --data "username=admin_$i&password=admin$i" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/ >/dev/null 2>&1;done
```{{exec}}

This will send a POST request to the homepage of my application and attempt to login with username admin_1..20 and the same value for the password, this will be enough to trigger the scenario.

We can check this by running `cscl decisions list` the IP address should be `127.0.0.1` ignore this for testing purposes the IP can be ignored the trigger is what matters.
