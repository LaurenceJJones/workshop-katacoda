Let's test our bruteforce detection scenario

We can simulate our own brute-force attempts using curl:

```
for i in {1..20}; do curl --data "username=admin_$i&password=admin$i" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/ >/dev/null 2>&1;done
```{{exec}}

This sends POST requests to the application's homepage and attempts logins with usernames `admin_1..20` and matching password values. This is enough to trigger the scenario.

We can check that the detection is working by running:
```
cscli decisions list
```{{exec}}

You should see an active decision for IP `10.10.10.10`{{}}. This is a hardcoded IP for the workshop and can be ignored.
