Great we have now created our parser and scenarios!

However, before deployment it is best that we test and ensure the detection is working as intended on a dev/staging environment. This is to ensure false positives are detected before deploying to production.

We have now spent time developing parsers and scenarios for `myapp`{{}}, and you can see the application in its full glory [here]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_3000}}). I know you are utterly amazed at my dev skills, but keep in mind this was coded in 15 minutes just for this workshop.

This application is a basic login portal that automatically generates the username and password at runtime, so brute-forcing should be impossible. In the next steps, we will test our scenarios and review detections with `cscli`.

Let's get our hacker mode on!
