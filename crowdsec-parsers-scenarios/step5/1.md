Great we have now created our parser and scenarios!

However, before deployment it is best that we test and ensure the detection is working as intended on a dev/staging environment. This is to ensure false positives are detected before deploying to production.

So we have spent time developing for parsers and scenarios for `myapp`{{}} and now you can see the application in its full glory [here]({{TRAFFIC_HOST1_80}}). Now I know you are utterlly amazed at my dev skills please keep in mind that this was coded in 15 minutes just for this workshop!

Now this application is a basic login portal that automatically generates the username and password at runtime so bruteforcing the user and password should be impossible. So in the next steps we will test our scenarios and see the detection via the cscli tool.

Let's get our hacker mode on!
