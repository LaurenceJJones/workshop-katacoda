```yaml
MANDATORY: NO
TYPE: []NODE
```
---
```yaml{1,5}
nodes:
  - grok:
      pattern: "%{RFC3339:timestamp} %{IPORHOST:source_ip}"
      apply_on: message
    nodes:
```

Now this is the heart of the parser the `nodes`{{}}! in short the `nodes`{{}} are a list of `node`{{}} object that parse information out of the event. Which if they are successful will inform the event to be passed over to `s02-enrich`{{}} stage.

Before we head into the first node what are we exactly trying to parse?!? Here are example log lines from myapp.

```
2023-01-10T21:13:10Z 10.10.10.10 resource not found URI=(/favicon.ico)
2023-01-10T21:13:13Z 10.10.10.10 invalid login request USER=(test)
2023-01-10T21:13:15Z 10.10.10.10 invalid login request USER=(test)
2023-01-10T21:13:20Z 10.10.10.10 invalid login request USER=(admin)
```

As you can see from the logs the first section is a datetime stamp followed by an internal IP address `10.10.10.10`{{}} (Since killercoda has multiple entry points I hardcoded the source_ip to `10.10.10.10` for this example)


So lets break down the first `node`{{}} in our `nodes`{{}} list!

```
nodes:
|_ Start the nodes array
|  - grok:
|___ '-' in yaml is an array item to which grok object key is supplied
  |    pattern: "%{RFC3339:timestamp} %{IPORHOST:source_ip}"
  |___ Within the grok object is a pattern which is the 'GROK' & 'RE2' string
  |    apply_on: message
  |___ Within the grok object is the apply_on which indicates which parsed key to apply the grok too.
```

But lets explain the `pattern`{{}} and how we came to use `apply_on: message`{{}}

GROK patterns can be rather complex depending on how configurable the application logs are. In this example mine is really simple just to get you used to the syntax.

```
pattern: "%{RFC3339:timestamp} %{IPORHOST:source_ip}"
            |                    |_IPORHOST grok pattern is applied and if successful will be saved in evt.Parsed.source_ip
            |_RFC3339 grok pattern is applied and if successful will be saved in evt.Parsed.timestamp

```

Where does `RFC3339`{{}} & `IPORHOST`{{}} grok patterns come from? By default crowdsec imports a list of common grok patterns that are used [LINK](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/parsers/patterns)



Lets add the `nodes`{{}} list and our first `node`{{}}
```
echo "nodes:
  - grok:
      pattern: "%{RFC3339:timestamp} %{IPORHOST:source_ip}"
      apply_on: message
    nodes:
" >> /etc/crowdsec/parsers/s01-parse/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}
