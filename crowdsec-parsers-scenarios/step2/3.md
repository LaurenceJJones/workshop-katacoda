A boolean flag that sets the debug mode of the node. This applies at runtime and during configuration parsing. In short, this will display extra information in CrowdSec logs while testing new parsers.


Most of the time you will find this key `#`{{}} commented out. If you are ever experiencing issues, setting `debug: true`{{}} could give you extra information. Warning: it is quite noisy and may take some time to understand the output!

We will add the debug option commented out for now. However, if you experience issues later, you can uncomment it.
```
echo "#debug: true" >> /etc/crowdsec/parsers/s01-parse/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}
