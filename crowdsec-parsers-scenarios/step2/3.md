#### optional

`TYPE: boolean`{{}}

```yaml{2}
name: username/myapp
#debug: true
filter: evt.Parsed.program == 'myapp'
onsuccess: next_stage
description: "This is my custom app"
```
A boolean flag that sets debug of the nod (applies at runtime and configuration parsing). In short this will show extra information in crowdsec logs whilst testing new parsers.

Most of the time you will find this key `#`{{}} commented out. If you are ever experiencing issues setting `debug: true`{{}} could give you extra information. Warning it is quite noisy and may take sometime to understand the output!

We will add the debug commented out for now, however, if you experience issues later we can uncommented.

```
echo "#debug: true" >> /etc/crowdsec/parsers/s01-parse/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}
