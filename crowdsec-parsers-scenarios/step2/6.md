Description is a short blurb of text that is shown on the hub page and can help others understand what this parser achieves.

Let's add a short description! Click the command below and enter a description within the terminal
```
read -p 'Description: ' userinput && echo "description: \"$userinput\"" >> /etc/crowdsec/parsers/s01-parse/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}

>If you can't think of a description, use my example above!
