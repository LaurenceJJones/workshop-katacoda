```yaml{3}
name: username/myapp
#debug: true
filter: evt.Parsed.program == 'myapp'
onsuccess: next_stage
description: "This is my custom app"
```

`filter`{{}} is an [expression](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/master/docs/Language-Definition.md) that will be evaluated against the runtime of a line (Event)

- if the `filter`{{}} is present and returns false, node is not evaluated
- if `filter`{{}} is absent or present and returns true, node is evaluated

For performance we suggest to always use `filter`{{}} since it will not waste resources testing the lines against `GROKS`{{}} that will never pass.

Before we implement this filter lets break down this current filter!

```
filter: evt.Parsed.program == 'myapp'
        |_Event
          |_ Accessing the current parsed variables
            |_ Which we are accessing the 'program' key
              |_ Which we are comparing if the value exactly matches 'myapp'
```

But wait! how does the `program`{{}} key come about? as outlined in the high level overview there are `s00-raw` parsers which don't parse the application logs but format the event firstly.

For our event the raw parser would of been `crowdsecurity/syslog-logs`{{}}. This is why on `unix`{{}} systems the `syslog-logs` raw parser is mandatory and automatically installed.

Here is exact section highlighted for ease.

```yaml{9,10}
#if it's not syslog, the type is the program
filter: "evt.Line.Labels.type != 'syslog'"
onsuccess: next_stage
name: crowdsecurity/non-syslog
#debug: true
statics:
  - parsed: message
    expression: evt.Line.Raw
  - parsed: program
    expression: evt.Line.Labels.type
  - meta: datasource_path
    expression: evt.Line.Src
  - meta: datasource_type
    expression: evt.Line.Module
```

This make sense when we look at acquis.yaml section that was added by myself. See `labels`{{}} and the `type`{{}} key which is accessed via `syslog-logs`{{}} raw parser!

```yaml{4,5}
---
filenames:
  - /var/log/myapp.log
labels:
  type: myapp
```

Now since we understand how this key is set we can now add it to the parser!
```
echo "filter: evt.Parsed.program == 'myapp'" >> /etc/crowdsec/parsers/s01-parse/myapp.yaml
```
