Indicates the behavior to follow if the node succeeds.

- next_stage make the line go to the next stage
- continue will continue processing the current stage.

Rather than stating the obvious what does this exactly mean?

In short you will most likely use `next_stage`{{}} in `s01-parse`{{}} stage because as soon as you've parsed the application log you want it to go to the next stage `s02-enrich`{{}}.

The `continue`{{}} behavior is default and is why you do not see this key in any `s02-enrich`{{}} parsers. You would want the data to go through all enrichers in `s02-enrich`{{}} stage before going to `scenarios`{{}}.

Lets add the `onsuccess`{{}} key to our parser!
```
echo "onsuccess: next_stage" >> /etc/crowdsec/parsers/s01-parse/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}
