That's it you have built you first custom parser!

Let's give it a try!

```
cscli explain --log "2023-01-10T21:13:20Z 10.10.10.10 invalid login request USER=(admin)" --type myapp -v
```{{exec}}

You should be able to see all the variables that were set during the `s01-parse`{{}} stage.

In this section of `Crowdsec Parsers and Scenarios for beginners`{{}} we have learnt the general structure of the `s01-parse`{{}} parser and how all the components fit together.

## Parsers need to know!

This section is helpful tips or need to know that couldn't slot into other sections.

- For an event to be fully enriched within `s02-enrich`{{}} stage you **MUST** within`s01-parse`{{}} stage set these variables
```
evt.Meta.source_ip -> offending remote ip
evt.StrTime -> timestamp of the log line
```
