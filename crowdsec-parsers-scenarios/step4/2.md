```yaml
---
type: trigger
name: myapp/login-blank-credentials
description: "Detect a login request that should never happen!" #Our application does not allow a request to be sent if username OR password is blank so if the backend receives this then the request must of been sent outside the application!
filter: "evt.Meta.sub_type == 'empty_username_pass'"
blackhole: 1m
groupby: "evt.Meta.source_ip"
labels:
  remediation: true
```

Here is an example of a `trigger`{{}} bucket! in simple terms, even a single event into this type of bucket will make it overflow. It can be useful to detect CVE or exploitation attempts, in the example above we are detecting if the user has sent an empty username or password which should never be the case due to the restrictions we place on the frontend.

Let's add the trigger bucket to our scenarios!
```
echo "---
type: trigger
name: myapp/login-blank-credentials
description: \"Detect a login request that should never happen\"
filter: \"evt.Meta.sub_type == 'empty_username_pass'\"
blackhole: 1m
groupby: \"evt.Meta.source_ip\"
labels:
  remediation: true" >> /etc/crowdsec/scenarios/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}
