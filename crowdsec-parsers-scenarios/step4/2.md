```yaml
---
type: trigger
name: myapp/login-blank-credentials
description: "Detect a login request that should never happen!" #Our application does not allow a request to be sent if username OR password is blank, so if the backend receives this then the request must have been sent outside the application!
filter: "evt.Meta.sub_type == 'empty_username_pass'"
blackhole: 1m
groupby: "evt.Meta.source_ip"
labels:
  remediation: true
```

Here is an example of a `trigger`{{}} bucket. In simple terms, even a single event in this type of bucket will make it overflow. This is useful for detecting CVE or exploitation attempts. In the example above, we detect when a user sends an empty username or password, which should never happen due to frontend restrictions.

Let's add the trigger bucket to our scenarios!
```
echo "---
type: trigger
name: myapp/login-blank-credentials
description: \"Detect a login request that should never happen\"
filter: \"evt.Meta.sub_type == 'empty_username_pass'\"
blackhole: 1m
groupby: \"evt.Meta.source_ip\"
labels:
  remediation: true" >> /etc/crowdsec/scenarios/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}
