```yaml
---
type: leaky
name: myapp/login-slow-bf
description: "Detect slow login brute forcing"
filter: "evt.Meta.sub_type == 'invalid_login'"
leakspeed: "1m"
capacity: 10
blackhole: 1m
groupby: "evt.Meta.source_ip"
labels:
  type: bruteforce
  remediation: true
```

The above bucket uses the same filter as the previous one, but with a higher `capacity`{{}} and a longer `leakspeed`{{}}.

The idea behind this bucket is that if a bot/user is `bruteforcing`{{}} an application and wants to evade detection, they may slow down attempts.

Example: if a bot/user sends a login attempt every `20 seconds`{{}}, they will still be detected. The previous bucket may be created and destroyed between requests due to its `10 second leakspeed`{{}}.

Let's add this bucket to make sure these slower attacks are detected!
