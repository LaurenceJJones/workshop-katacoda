```yaml
---
type: leaky
name: myapp/login-slow-bf
description: "Detect slow login brute forcing"
filter: "evt.Meta.sub_type == 'invalid_login'"
leakspeed: "1m"
capacity: 10
blackhole: 1m
groupby: "evt.Meta.source_ip"
labels:
  type: bruteforce
  remediation: true
```

The above bucket is the same filter as the previous one, however, the `capacity`{{}} is greater with a longer `leakspeed`{{}}.

The reasoning behind this bucket is that if a bot/user is `bruteforcing`{{}} an application and wants to evade detection, they may slow down the attempts. 

Example: if a bot/user sends a login attempt every `20 seconds`{{}} they will still be detected, however, the previous bucket will be created and destroyed between requests due to `10 second leakspeed`{{}}.

Let's add this bucket to make sure these slower attacks are detected!
```
