Here is another example of a `leaky`{{}} bucket, however, this is what we class as a long life bucket and has a special property called `cache_size`{{}}.

By default, a bucket holds capacity events "in memory". However, for a number of cases, you don't want this as it might lead to excessive memory consumption.

By setting cache_size to a positive integer we can control the maximum in-memory cache size of the bucket, without changing its capacity and such. It is useful when buckets are likely to stay alive for a long time or ingest a lot of events to avoid storing a lot of events in memory.

Let's add our long life bucket!
```
echo "---
type: leaky
name: myapp/crawler
description: \"Detect aggressive crawl from single ip\"
filter: \"evt.Meta.sub_type == 'http_bruteforce'\"
distinct: \"evt.Parsed.http_path\"
leakspeed: 0.5s
capacity: 40
cache_size: 5
groupby: \"evt.Meta.source_ip\"
blackhole: 1m
labels:
 service: http
 type: crawl
 remediation: true" >> /etc/crowdsec/scenarios/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}
