Labels is a list of label: values that provide context to an overflow. The labels are (currently) not stored in the database, nor they are sent to the API.

Special labels :

    The remediation label, if set to true indicates that the originating IP should be remediated.

> What does remediated mean?

> Since crowdsec bouncers can handle different types of remediation (captcha, block, redirect) the word remediated is used instead of the term `banned`{{}}

Let's add our labels
```
echo "labels:
  type: bruteforce
  remediation: true" >> /etc/crowdsec/scenarios/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}
