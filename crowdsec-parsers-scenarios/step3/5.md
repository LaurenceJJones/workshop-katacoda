`filter`{{}} is an [expression](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr/blob/master/docs/Language-Definition.md) that will be evaluated against the runtime of a line (Event)

This is the exact same `filter`{{}} expression that was explained inside the parser section, however, because we took the extra steps to create the child nodes, our filter can be much simpler!

Since we have multiple different `sub_type`{{}} we can just filter down by this key and if it matches the string exactly.

Let's add this filter!

```
echo "filter: \"evt.Meta.sub_type == 'invalid_login'\"" >> /etc/crowdsec/scenarios/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}
