Now we can move on to creating the scenario files for our application!

In this next section we will break down the concept of bucket types and how each can be used.

Here the scenarios we will be creating.

```yaml
type: leaky
name: myapp/login-bf
description: "Detect login brute forcing"
filter: "evt.Meta.sub_type == 'invalid_login'"
leakspeed: "10s"
capacity: 3
blackhole: 1m
groupby: "evt.Meta.source_ip"
labels:
  type: bruteforce
  remediation: true
---
type: leaky
name: myapp/login-slow-bf
description: "Detect slow login brute forcing"
filter: "evt.Meta.sub_type == 'invalid_login'"
leakspeed: "1m"
capacity: 10
blackhole: 1m
groupby: "evt.Meta.source_ip"
labels:
  type: bruteforce
  remediation: true
---
type: trigger
name: myapp/login-blank-credentials
description: "Detect a login request that should never happen!" #Our application does not allow a request to be sent if username OR password is blank so if the backend receives this then the request must of been sent outside the application!
filter: "evt.Meta.sub_type == 'empty_username_pass'"
blackhole: 1m
groupby: "evt.Meta.source_ip"
labels:
  remediation: true
---
type: leaky
name: myapp/crawler
description: "Detect aggressive crawl from single ip"
filter: "evt.Meta.sub_type == 'http_bruteforce'"
distinct: "evt.Parsed.http_path"
leakspeed: 0.5s
capacity: 40
cache_size: 5
groupby: "evt.Meta.source_ip"
blackhole: 1m
labels:
 service: http
 type: crawl
 remediation: true
```

Lets go!
