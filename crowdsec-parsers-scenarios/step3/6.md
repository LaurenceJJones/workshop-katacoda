```yaml{5}

description: "Detect login brute forcing"
filter: "evt.Meta.sub_type == 'invalid_login'"

Only applies to leaky buckets.

A duration that represents how often an event will be leaking from the bucket.

Must be compatible with [golang ParseDuration format](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).

Examples:

- "10s" -> 10 Seconds
- "10m" -> 10 Minutes
- "10h" -> 10 Hours

Check the image [here](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/scenarios/format#leakspeed) to understand what a leaked event does.

Let's add the leakspeed for 10 seconds!
```
echo "leakspeed: \"10s\"" >> /etc/crowdsec/scenarios/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}
