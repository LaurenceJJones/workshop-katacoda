```yaml{6}
type: leaky
name: myapp/login-bf
description: "Detect login brute forcing"
filter: "evt.Meta.sub_type == 'invalid_login'"
leakspeed: "10s"
capacity: 3
blackhole: 1m
groupby: "evt.Meta.source_ip"
labels:
  type: bruteforce
  remediation: true
```

Only applies to leaky buckets.

A positive integer representing the bucket `capacity`{{}}. If there are more than `capacity`{{}} item in the bucket, it will overflow.

In the example above we can see the capacity is `3`{{}} that means if a single IP address fails with the `sub_type`{{}} that equals `'invalid_login'`{{}} and the count gets to `4`{{}} whilst `leaking`{{}} it will then `overflow`{{}}

```
echo "capacity: 3" >> /etc/crowdsec/scenarios/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}
