```yaml
MANDATORY: YES
TYPE: STRING
#STRING MUST BE leaky|trigger|counter
```
```yaml{1}
type: leaky
name: myapp/login-bf
description: "Detect login brute forcing"
filter: "evt.Meta.sub_type == 'invalid_login'"
leakspeed: "10s"
capacity: 3
blackhole: 1m
groupby: "evt.Meta.source_ip"
labels:
  type: bruteforce
  remediation: true
```

Defines the type of bucket. Depending on the type of the bucket, they act in different manners:

- `leaky`{{}}: a [leaky bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket) that must be configured with a capacity and a leakspeed
- `trigger`{{}}: a bucket that overflows as soon as an event is poured (it is like a leaky bucket is a capacity of 0)
- `counter`{{}}: a bucket that only overflows every duration. It is especially useful to count things.

I find that the types `counter`{{}} and `trigger`{{}} are quite self-explanatory. However, if you wish to have a better understanding of a `leaky`{{}} bucket then check out the breakdown [here](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/scenarios/format#leakspeed).

Let's start by building the example above!

```
echo "type: leaky" >> /etc/crowdsec/scenarios/myapp.yaml
```{{exec}}
