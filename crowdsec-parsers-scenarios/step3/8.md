```

A duration for which a bucket will be "silenced" after overflowing. This is intended to limit / avoid spam of buckets that might be very rapidly triggered.

The blackhole only applies to the individual bucket rather than the whole scenario.

> How do I know which bucket will be silenced?

> It depends on the `groupby`{{}} key this is what makes buckets unique

Must be compatible with [golang ParseDuration format](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).
