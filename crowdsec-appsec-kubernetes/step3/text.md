# Step 4: Update the remediation component middleware

Now we have the AppSec pod running, we need to update the middleware to use the AppSec.

## Show the values file

```bash
cat bouncer-middleware.yaml
```{{exec}}

We enable the AppSec module by setting `crowdsecAppsecEnabled` to `true`. 

We are using crowdsecMode: none, because it works in real-time, but it queries the database for each connection. In production, we recommend stream for any substantial amount of traffic. For all the possible modes see [the pluginâ€™s documentation](https://plugins.traefik.io/plugins/6335346ca4caa9ddeffda116/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin).

## Update the bouncer middleware

```bash
kubectl apply -f bouncer-middleware.yaml
```{{exec}}

For more information, see [Routing Configuration / Kind: Middleware](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/providers/kubernetes-crd/#kind-middleware).

We can verify that there is no errors in the dashboard.

## Access the Traefik dashboard

[ACCESS TRAEFIK DASHBOARD/MIDDLEWARES]({{TRAFFIC_HOST2_8080}}/dashboard/#/http/middlewares)

In the dashboard, you can have a look at the routers. The bouncer plugin is now updated.
