# Analyzing a breach

## Introduction

In this workshop we will act as a security analyst that has been brought into a company that has been breached.

We will go through 2 scenarios:
1) Manually analyze the breach
* Gain insight into how the breach happened
* Understand what the attacker did
* Understand what data was stolen
2) Use CrowdSec to automate some of the analysis to speed up the process
* Understand what elements of the analysis CrowdSec can help with
* Understand how some of the breach may have been alerted/prevented by CrowdSec
